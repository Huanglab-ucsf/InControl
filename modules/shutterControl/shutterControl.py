# Master class for shutter control.
#
# This class handles parsing XML shutter files and turning
# them into Python arrays that specify the different
# shutter/AOTF sequences. It also handles the various get functions.
# The user should subclass this class and add setup, startFilm,
# stopFilm and cleanup methods following eg. storm3ShutterControl.
